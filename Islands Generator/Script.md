## Hello!

Recently I created a versatile system to generate islands in Unity and want to share my experience. I faced many issues, that were not so easy to solve, so I decided to describe and share the algorithm. The full code is not provided, because I just want to explain ways of how to fix some common problems, that may occur in many other projects, plus my code is not perfect for sure.

<br>

### **Stage 1 : Perlin noise as a base**

<br>

I used usual Perlin Noise algorithm, conviently implemented in Unity in ```Mathf.PerlinNoise()``` function. Basically, you use it with 2 parameters: x and y, and it returns value in this position. To have a randomly generated map each time you should shift your coordinates randomly. 

```c#
Mathf.PerlinNoise(x * noise.scale + noise.xOffset, y * noise.scale + noise.yOffset)
```

When the value in the specific point is greater than threshold, then it is ground, otherwise it's water. The visualization describes this perfectly: peaks are islands, troughs are water.

Let's call this function ```IsGround(x, y) => bool``` for later.

<br>

### **Stage 2 : Islands detection**

<br>

Initially I should mention, that we have a main function, that loops through the whole map and tries to detect islands.

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < worldWidth; i++)
	for (int j = 0; j < worldWidth; j++)
		// if it's ground here and there is no island detected yet
		if (islandIds[i, j] == -1 && IsGround(i, j))
			GenerateIsland(islandIds, i, j);
```

For the optimization I needed to distinguish islands. We have a matrix, where every ```(x, y)``` pair (tile coords) is attached to int (basic 2d int array with x and y axis). It represents the map of detected islands' indicies. 
In the main loop if there is land in current position and there is no island detected here, then ```GenerateIsland``` is been invoken. It runs ```GetIslandTiles``` function to get coords of all tiles that correspond to this island. It works by recursively checking all positions around given and stops, when all calls get completed.

```c#
private void GenerateIsland(int[,] islandIds, int i, int j)
{
	List<(int, int)> tiles = new List<(int, int)>();

	// GetIslandTiles writes all island's tiles into tiles list
	GetIslandTiles(islands.Count, tiles, islandIds, i, j);
	
	// islands is a list of lists of position, so basically the list of islands
	islands.Add(tiles);
	
	// wait for it
	(float x, float y, int xSize, int ySize, float minX, float minY) = CalculateTextureRect(tiles);
	GenerateIslandSprite(GenerateIslandTexture(tiles, xSize, ySize, minX, minY), x, y);
}
```

With this working I have access to manipulate each island separately. For example, I set up a filter to remove too small islands to achieve more natural look and better playing experience by checking tiles.Count value is greater than threshold.

<br>

### **Stage 3 : Texture generation**

<br>

On the first attempt I instantiated all land tiles and got the final visual of floating islands. However, this process lasted for a few minutes and the performance was unplayably bad. The main problem was not the amount of triangles but the amount of batches. There were way too many objects in the scene, thus videocard couldn't process all the requests from processor in the given 15 milliseconds.

The first obvious solution seemed to enable static batching in the game. But these objects had been generated in runtime, so there was no way to apply static batching on them, but dynamic. Sadly, dynamic batching does its work not so well with that count of objects and I was not happy with that.

This is why I decided to extend my system not just to instantiate tiles but to merge thier sprites onto an island's texture. This reduces the overall count of objects hundred times which provides perfect performance even for a huge map.

This is the algorithm of creating island's texture:

Create a function ```AddImage2Texture``` that adds sprite to a certain local position with alpha (if you have isometric map, you have to use alpha). The issue is that 
```Texture2D.SetPixels()``` do not add sprites, but override them. So it makes it impossible to add images with alpha channel native way. ```AddImage2Texture``` is designed to actually add images to the texture. Basically, it runs through the sprite you want to add and if it detects transparent pixel, it replaces it with the correspond pixel on the texture on the same global coordinates. So it takes the pixel from underneath it and puts right into current sprite. With this magic done it overrides target texture spot with the new one.

```c#
// colors is basically the texture you add to tex (basic texture of island)
private void AddImage2Texture(Texture2D tex, Color[] colors, Vector2Int imagePosition)
{
	// colors is a sprite to add converted to an array of colors

	// alpha-fixed sprite to add
	Color[] _colors = new Color[colors.Length];

    // go through all pixels
	for (int i = 0; i < colors.Length; i++)
	{
        // If pixel is transparent, then take a pixel from underneath
		if (Mathf.Approximately(colors[i].a, 0))
		{
            // Here we calculate position of current pixel on the tex. This pixel is placed right under current one.
			int x = imagePosition.x + i % tileSize.x;
			int y = imagePosition.y + i / tileSize.x;

			_colors[i] = tex.GetPixel(x, y);
		}
		// otherwise just put current pixel in the new sprite
		else
			_colors[i] = colors[i];
	}
    // At this stage _colors does not have any transparent pixels and we can hardly rewrite this set of pixel on island's texture.
	tex.SetPixels(imagePosition.x, imagePosition.y, tileSize.x, tileSize.y, _colors);
}
```

We go through all tiles' positions and apply sprites into the texture using ```AddImage2Texture``` function. 

In case of using isometric geometry the matrix position to isometric position convertation function is essential to be written.

```c#
// Takes int matrix position and returns appropriate isometric position
public static Vector2 ConvertPosition(int x, int y)
{
	return new Vector2(x, y + x / 2f);
}
```

### **Stage 4 : Combining all together**

<br>

In this snipped of code from **Stage 2** I mentioned ```CalculateTextureRect``` and ```GenerateIslandSprite``` functions. Let's have a look on those.
> ```c#
> islands.Add(tiles);
>	
>	// wait for it
>	(float x, float y, int xSize, int ySize, float minX, float minY) =  CalculateTextureRect(tiles);
>	GenerateIslandSprite(GenerateIslandTexture(tiles, xSize, ySize, minX, minY), x, y);
>}

#### **CalculateTextureRect**

This function calculates bounds and position of a texture. It inputs a list of ```(int, int)``` pairs, which are tiles' positions of an island. Firstly we define minX and maxX values, which are basically the boundaries of texture by X axis. This is how it works:
```c#
float minX = tiles.Min(pos => ConvertPosition(pos.Item1, pos.Item2).x);
```
And so on for other 3 parameters (maxX, minY, maxY).
Then we use them to calculate width and height of texture and also coordinates x and y.
In addition, it calculates center position of target texture for the next function.

#### **GenerateIslandSprite**

This is a very basic function that instantiates a gameobject and applies the input texture to it through ```SpriteRenderer```. It also sets position to the calculated by ```CalculateTextureRect``` coordinates.

### **Stage 5 : Extensions**

<br>

<details>
<summary> Applying island size threshold </summary>

<br>

>*I have access to manipulate each island separately. For example, I set up a filter to remove too small islands to achieve more natural look and better playing experience by checking tiles.Count value is greater than threshold. \*Stage 2*

```tiles.Count``` field provides information about area of an island.
```cs
if (tiles.Count <= threscholdIslandSize) return;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> Creating light outline for islands </summary>

<br>

One can use perlin noise to detect whether the certain position on the map is shallow water (is between two border height values) and make these spots lighter to achieve realistic water appearance.

<br>

</details>

<details>
<summary> Procedural generation </summary>

<br>

This algorithm supports procedural world generation extension.
Set up generating islands in a certain chunk but instead of cutting off excess parts that are out of world's border let them spawn entirely for better visual and preventing algorithm from glitches of generating same islands for several times unnecessary.

## **Some statistics**

<br>

I ran my generator with different settings on my laptop and put average results in the table:

|   â„–   | world width | world area | time(s) | GCa (MB) |
| :---: | :---------- | :--------- | :-----: | :------: |
|   1   | $1*10^2$    | $1.0*10^4$ |  1.285  |   46.9   |
|   2   | $2*10^2$    | $4.0*10^4$ |  2.187  |  238.6   |
|   3   | $3*10^2$    | $9.0*10^4$ |  4.530  |  522.2   |
|   4   | $4*10^2$    | $1.6*10^5$ |  9.453  |  983.0   |
|   5   | $5*10^2$    | $2.5*10^5$ | 14.035  |  1495.0  |
|   6   | $6*10^2$    | $3.6*10^5$ | 20.916  |  2222.0  |
|   7   | $7*10^2$    | $4.9*10^5$ | 28.309  |  3000.3  |
|   8   | $1*10^3$    | $1.0*10^6$ | 55.911  |  2160.6  |

<br>

Each test was repeated twice for better accuracy. With the ```noise scale``` parameter equals to ```0.04``` and ```noise threshold``` to ```0.65``` ground density is ```13.667%```.

This statistics was gathered with unity profiler by wrapping generation code with ```UnityEngine.Profiling.Profiler.BeginSample()``` and ```UnityEngine.Profiling.Profiler.EndSample()```

## Conclusion

Personally I really love how this idea turned out. The speed and efficiency of this algorithm blowed up my mind.

As it is my first actual article I am looking forward to listen for criticism. Be free to comment!:D

## About project

<br>

I am developing tower-defence game about resource collection and processing automatization and defence management. Player needs to build up his base entirely on islands to gather resources and fight out enemies. It seems quite similar to Mindustry.
